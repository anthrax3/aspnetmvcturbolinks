#  Turbolinks in ASP.NET MVC
Demonstrates the [Rails TurboLinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks/) 
integration in ASP.NET MVC. Please note that all the rules/tricks/gotchas of 
the original Turbolinks also applies here.

The sample originated from [RailsCasts 390 episode](http://railscasts.com/episodes/390-turbolinks) 
but also utilizes the built-in Ajax helpers of ASP.NET MVC for seamless smooth
ux.
